# Slow Story Telling Web Frame

This is a framework for a **web game** based on node.js and MySQL. The game is of the **story telling** type; similar but not the same as Interactive Fiction.

In **Interactive Fiction** games you can have quick responses for your actions. If that's what you're interested on, check frameworks like [Twinery](https://twinery.org/) and several others.

It is **slow** because the story isn't really interactive. The story is told in parts, slowly. Then you perform actions that will, later, advance the story. You need to check on the game state once a while to see results, read, then take actions that will take time to advance the story. Hence, **slow**.

## Features

- Story is told in chapters/parts. You advance to different parts of the story depending on your actions.
- Different characters. You can have only one character, or several ones. More can be created later in the story, and some can die or leave the story, but several different characters may appear in it.
